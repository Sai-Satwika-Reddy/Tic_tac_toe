# Tic_tac_toe
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic game that can be played by two players. This project is a simple implementation of the game using React.js. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and players take turns placing their marks (X or O) in empty squares. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
